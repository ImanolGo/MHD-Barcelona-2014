 --- Sonar Knights ---

Once upon a time long ago, even before the days of King Arthur, lived a couple of knights known in every kingdom as….the Hackers. They might have not been the strongest nor the fastest among all, but they had their brains. In fact, in their heart they secretly longed to win the hand of Princess Sonar.

The Princess was so beautiful, that she was desired by every Knights across all oceans. But she couldn’t find anyone who shared her passion, Music. The King, aware of that, decided to organise the most creative and brutal musical hack fight.

The Hackers joined forces to win the Princess from any unjust tyrant. They came up with a great idea. They will train and train until they could tell any story with the perfect music companion. 

But how? you may ask……so well, using magic!!! They will first look for the most beautiful sounds in Freesound related story and to accompany their voices. But not only that, their friend Essentia is a very good actor. He is able to distinguish the finest nuances from any narrator to orchestrate the music.

Many knights went to battle and many knights got rejected by the princess. At the end, in desperation the King said to proclaim winner whoever is capable to make the princess laugh. Finally, our heroes were able to win.
