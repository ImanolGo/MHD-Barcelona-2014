Music Hack Day Barcelona Sonar 2014 - http://new.musichackday.org/2014/barcelona/

Ideas:

1. Kids story: having the text from a kid's book, the hack parses it and searchs Freesound.org for suitable sounds depending on the narrative.

Approach: speech to text recognition, Freesound.org database search based on number of hits for key sounds, sound effects triggering, audio input modification in Pd.
