Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess who had a golden ball. One day, while playing in the garden, the ball fell into a pond. She was very upset and did not know what to do. While she sat there cry­ing helplessly, a frog hopped out of the pond and asked, “Why are you crying, little princess?” She told him about her golden ball. The ugly frog said, “I can help you get your ball but what will you give me in return?” “I will give you any­thing you want!” promised the princess. The frog immediately dived into the water and fetched the ball for her. The princess was very happy. The frog reminded her, “Remem­ber that you promised me anything. Well, I want to be your friend, eat from your plate, and sleep in your palace!” The princess hated the idea but she agreed and ran back to the palace.
The next morning, the princess found the frog waiting for her. He said, “I have come to live in your palace.” Hearing this, the princess ran to her fa­ther, crying. When the kind king heard about the promise, he told her, “A promise is a promise and you must keep your word. You must let the frog stay here.” The princess was very angry but she had no choice and let the frog stay. He ate from her plate during dinner and asked the princess to take him to her bed at night. The princess picked him up an­grily and threw him to the floor.
In a flash, the frog turned into a handsome prince! He told the princess that he had actually been under the spell of a wicked witch. The princess fell in love with the prince. They were married and lived happily ever after.
